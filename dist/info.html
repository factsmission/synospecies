    <h2>About SynoSpecies</h2>
    <p>
      SynoSpecies is a tool developed by FactsMission AG to leverage the RDF data provided by Plazi. The RDF data of all
      treatments is stored in an
      <a href="https://allegrograph.com/">AllegroGraph</a> triple store allowing
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/">SPARQL</a> queries over the data. SynoSpecies allows manually
      writing and submitting such queries in the advanced mode and send such queries in the background when using the
      easier interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      SynoSpecies is an Open Source application running purely in the browser, the source code is available on
      <a href="https://github.com/factsmission/synospecies/">GitHub</a>.

    <h2>Explanation of the Interface</h2>

    <h3>Search</h3>
    <p>
      SynoSpecies supports using any of the following as search terms:
    <ul>
      <li>
        A human readable taxon name in the form <span class="uri">Genus</span>,
        <span class="uri">Genus species</span>, or <span class="uri">Genus species infraspecific</span>.
        <br>
        The input field will offer auto-complete suggestions for this.
      </li>
      <li>
        A URI for a taxon-name or taxon-concept, i.e. a URI starting with
        <span class="uri">http://taxon-name.plazi.org/</span> or <span
          class="uri">http://taxon-concept.plazi.org/</span>.
        <br>
        <small>(You can find these by expanding any of the search results by clicking the
          <s-icon icon="justification" style="font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: sub;"></s-icon>)</small>
      </li>
      <li>
        A URI for a Catalogue of Life-taxon, i.e. a URI starting with
        <span class="uri">https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/taxon/</span>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Options</h4>
    <p>
      If the “Show CoL-synonyms” option is <i>disabled</i>, SynoSpecies will not follow
      <s-icon icon="col_dpr" style="font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: sub;"></s-icon>-synonyms listed in the Catalogue
      of Life.
      They will still be shown if they are found via treatment citations.
      Use this option if you get too many deprecated synonyms otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the “Include subtaxa of search term” option is <i>enabled</i>, SynoSpecies will also search for all taxa that
      are subtaxa of the search term.
      For example, with this option enabled, a search for “Mini” will also include “Mini ature, “Mini mum”, and “Mini
      scule”, as if you also searched for these.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the “Do not search for Synonyms” option is <i>enabled</i>,
      SynoSpecies will look up only the search term (and possibly its subtaxa), but it will not show any other synonyms.
      This is usually faster, and can be useful if you are only interested in the treatments for a specific taxon.
    </p>
    <p>
      These options are added to the URL parameters, so if you bookmark or share a given search this preserves the options used.
    </p>

    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <p>
      The Timeline visualizes the data in a two-dimensional grid.
      Here, the rows correspond to taxon names and the columns correspond to years of treatments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually, one row corresponds to one taxon and one authority.
      However, if there are multiple authorities given for a taxon (or if some treatments omit the authority entirely),
      The taxon is split into multiple rows with the top row used for authority-less citations
      and underneath one row per authority.

      In such cases, the
      <s-icon icon="collapse" style="font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: sub;"></s-icon>/<s-icon icon="expand"
        style="font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: sub;"></s-icon>
      buttons can be used to collapse/expand the taxon into one row.
      If there are many authorities given for one taxon, the row will be collapsed by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hint: To quickly scroll to a given taxon in the list below, click its name on the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the right half of the Timeline, we find a visualization of all treatments found, grouped by year.
      A yellow bar always indicates a single treatment. Hover over one to reveal its authors.

      If there are multiple treatments in one year, they can be collapsed into one blue bar showing aggregate counts of the icons.
      Clicking a blue bar or the
      <s-icon icon="expand" style="font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: sub;"></s-icon>
      buttons next to the year number will expand the year to show all its treatments.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are entries of the Catalogue of Life found, the corresponding synonym-relationships are shown in the
      first column as there is no date information here.
      Here too is a blue bar used for the collapsed (union) state, and (when expanded) separate yellow bars for each
      accepted name and its synonyms.
    </p>

    <h3>Other Notes</h3>
    <p>
      In some rare cases, mostly with viruses, entries the Catalogue of Life is missing explict <code class="uri">dwc:genericName</code> and <code>dwc:specificEpithet</code> annotaions.
      In this case, it is no longer possible for synospecies to correlate the Catalogue of Life-entry with the corresponding Plazi entry.
      To indicate this, the name of the (Catalogue of Life) taxon is surrounded with quotation marks.
    </p>
