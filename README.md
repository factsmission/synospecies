# About

Synospecies is a tool developed by FactsMission AG to leverage the RDF data provided by Plazi. The RDF data of all
treatments is stored in an [AllegroGraph](https://allegrograph.com/) triple store allowing
[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) queries over the data. Synospecies allows manually writing and
submitting such queries in the advanced mode and send such queries in the background when using the easier
interface.

Synospecies is an Open Source application running purely in the browser, the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/factsmission/synospecies/).

## [Plazi](http://plazi.org/)

Plazi is an association supporting and promoting the development of persistent and openly accessible digital taxonomic
literature. To this end Plazi will:
* Maintain a digital taxonomic literature repository to enable archiving of taxonomic treatments.
* Enhance submitted taxonomic treatments by creating TaxonX and Taxpub XML versions.
* Participate in the development of new models for publishing taxonomic treatments in order to maximize
  interoperability with other relevant cyberinfrastructure components (e.g., name servers, biodiversity resources, etc...)
* Advocate and educate about the vital importance of maintaining free and open access to scientific discourse and
  data
