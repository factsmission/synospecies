        SynoSpecies is a tool developed by FactsMission AG to leverage the RDF data provided by Plazi. The RDF data of all treatments is stored in an
        <a href="https://allegrograph.com/">AllegroGraph</a> triple store allowing
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/">SPARQL</a> queries over the data. SynoSpecies allows manually writing and submitting such queries in the advanced mode and send such queries in the background when using the easier interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        SynoSpecies is an Open Source application running purely in the browser, the source code is available on
        <a
